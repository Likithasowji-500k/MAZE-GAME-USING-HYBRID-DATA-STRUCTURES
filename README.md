# MAZE-GAME-USING-HYBRID-DATA-STRUCTURES

## Overview

The maze game with level order tree traversal is a project that involves designing a game where the player has to navigate through a maze to reach the end goal. The objective of the project is to implement an algorithm which finds the shortest path from the starting position to the end goal using level order tree traversal.
The starting point will be at the any one of the edges of the matrix and the black coloured box represent that the path is blocked. so the algorithm navigate sthrough diffent paths and provide sthe shortest path

## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a fun and challenging experience for players while demonstrating the practical applications of hybrid data structures in maze navigation.

## Features

- Hybrid data structure combining 2D arrays and trees
- Maze generation algorithm
- Shortest path finding using level order tree traversal
- GUI for visualizing the maze and solution path

## Practical Applications

- Game development
- Pathfinding in robotics
- Navigation in autonomous vehicles

## Implementation Details

- Hybrid data structure of a matrix combined with a tree of Node objects
- Key functions: constructTree(), findpaths(), findroute()
- Performance analysis: time complexity, space complexity
- Experimental setup and methodology for performance measurement

  ### Prerequisites
```bash
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Pygame library installed (`pip install pygame`).
```
## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze.
- Reach the end goal while avoiding obstacles to win the game.
